This code bundle contains the code files for the following chapters:

Chapter 2:- This example demonstrates the initialization, stepping and shutdown of PhysX SDK version 3.3.0
	    It is more like 'Hello World' program for PhysX SDK and contains minimal code.
			
Chapter 3:- This example demonstrates how to change the properties of dynamic rigid body in PhysX.
	    A dynamic rigid body can have properties like- mass, density, velocity, acceleration
	    angular-motion and so on. This program also uses 'Freeglut' library which is a cross-platform 
	    windowing toolkit that provides us OpenGL rendering context as well as keyboard and mouse events. 
	    Freeglut can be downloaded from http://freeglut.sourceforge.net

Chapter 4:- This example demonstrates how to use simulation event callbacks like- onTrigger() and onContact().
	    A customized FilterShader is also used in this program. Results of simulation events are printed on
	    the glut console window. This program also shows how to enable CCD (Continuous Collision Detection)
 	    for a ridig body.
			
Chapter 5:- This example demonstrates how to create joints (constraints) between two PhysX actors.
	    PhysX SDK provides six types of joints which are:- Fixed Joint, Revolute Joint, Spherical Joint,
	    Distance joint, Prismatic joint and D6 joint. This example demostrates some of of joints with
	    their specific configuration.
			
Chapter 6:- This example demonstrates how to perform scene queries like-Raycast query in PhysX SDK.

Chapter 7:- This example demonstrates how to use Character Controller in PhysX SDK.

Chapter 8:- This example demonstrates how to create Particles in PhysX SDK.
 
Chapter 9:- This example demonstrates how to create cloth in PhysX SDK. Cloths are used for
 	    simulating cloth behavior of a game character or for simulating realistic behavior
	    of deformable objects like- flags and curtains in a game environment.
			
Chapter 10:- This example demonstrates how to connect your PhysX application with 'PhysX Visual Debugger'.
	     PVD is used for debugging and visualization of PhysX simulation. It can be used for run-time
	     visualization of PhysX scene as well as its data can be saved as file for later on analysis.
